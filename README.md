## Installation Instructions 
This script needs to be run on an Anaconda Python kernel with Pandas and Geoviews libreries. If you run this script on Visual Studio Code, you need to ensure that your kernel is Anaconda Python. In any case, if you run this on Jupyter Notebook, you shouldnâ€™t have any problems.
## Usage
If you open the script and run it, you can view all the results. However, if you want to run it again, it could display errors because some data frames are modified. To solve this, you need to restart your kernel.
## Credits
